# Deep Learning Cheat Sheet

With this cheat sheet you will have a basic understanding of Deep Learning without getting involved math too much.Lets begin ,but first things first, what are the advantages and 
disadvantages of Deep Learning.

## Input Layer:
Where data enters the model, computers interst in only tensors so if your data is an image you should be flatten it into tensor.

## Hidden Layer:
Where all computations happens. 

## Output Layer:
Where you get your outputs but it depends on your task if you are working on classification problem what you get will (num_of_classes,1) shaped tensor.

## Activation Function:
Activation functions where power of deep learning lies, for visualizing a simple image.

As data get more distributed it is harder to fit on it for linear function, but non-linear function seems okey and difference is quite obvious. But what it does actually is creating non-linearity.


## Loss Function
